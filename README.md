2. App Idea: 
The app is designed to be a seamless productivity tool with cross-platform compatibility, syncing across devices (desktop, phone, iPad) via iCloud and WiFi, so users can access their tasks and calendar anywhere. It offers task sharing via email for collaborative planning, allowing users to easily share events or tasks. A smart daily overview automatically generates the userâ€™s schedule for the day, showing events and tasks when they open the app. The app integrates a visual calendar where users can plan events and link tasks and notes to specific times, offering multiple views like daily, weekly, and list formats for flexibility. Notes can be added as events, with tags like #DAY-TIME to help organize tasks and reminders, and these will automatically appear on the calendar at the appropriate times. Users can also create and save morning routines, which can be added to any day. Reminders for upcoming tasks or deadlines are highlighted, and users can customize views for calendar, notes, and reminders, seeing them all simultaneously for a comprehensive daily overview. The design is minimalist, with tasks, events, and reminders displayed in a clean, list-based format to provide a calming and user-friendly experience. It would also be ideal to include time stamps of all contributions, similar to OneNote.
